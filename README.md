This is an interactive installation created as part of my graduation requirements for a Masters in Science from the University of Victoria.

The project utilizes the [dreamIO](https://github.com/sabjorn/dreamIO) development board, which consists of a WiFi enabled microcontroller, an array of RGB leds, battery management system, and IMU.

This project includeds a case, to be laser cut or CNC milled, for wrapping around the DreamIO board.
